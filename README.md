**Monteux Automation Engine Extensions**
====================

**Monteux Automation Engine** is a GPLed framework for Java SE 6 or newer that implements a Lego(tm)-like modular, plug and play Automation Framework with a built-in shell and script interpreter.

The automation is based on **tasks lists** and **object stacks**, interacting with the environment via **HIDs**. 

This package provides **Tasks** that extend the **Automation Engine** functionality.
